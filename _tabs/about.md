## Who I am

My name is Philippe, also known under the alias _Philogy_ throughout the web,
I'm a smart contract developer, auditor and most recently compiler engineer
working on my own smart contract language (I share some details [in this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lZu1c7tZ-0)).

Currently my areas of interest are:
- Compiler Engineering & Language Design
  - Security centered lang design
  - Cutting compiler optimization techniques
  - How to build IDE-grade parsers
- Lean4 & automated theorem proving
- Piano
