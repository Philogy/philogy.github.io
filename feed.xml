I initially didn’t submit a solution due to personal time constraints and issues with foundry scripts that made it impossible to submit directly using them.

Recently we have decided to stop the project so that we can each work on other things and pursue things we’re more interested in.

Doing any of those actions wrong may result in you harming your finances and/or becoming legally liable if you e.g. misstate your income on tax forms.

I made a few 0xMonaco cars as well, but at the end we went with the car my teammates made since I was only able to work on mine for a few hours. I did not attempt or look at any of the Cairo / So... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Constant Gas Function Dispatchers in the EVM</title><link href="https://philogy.github.io/posts/selector-switches/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Constant Gas Function Dispatchers in the EVM" /><published>2022-03-16T18:55:00+01:00</published> <updated>2023-07-26T11:38:35+02:00</updated> <id>https://philogy.github.io/posts/selector-switches/</id> <content src="https://philogy.github.io/posts/selector-switches/" /> <author> <name>Philippe Dumonet</name> </author> <category term="smart-contract-development" /> <summary> Image: Telecom switchboard operator1 Intro Every2 smart contract on Ethereum and other EVM chains starts with its function dispatcher.

I’ll also refer to function dispatchers as “selector switches” as they remind of Telecom switchboard operat... </summary> </entry> </feed>
